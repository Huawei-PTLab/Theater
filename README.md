# Theater : iOS Actor Model Framework

Writing async, resilient and responsive applications is too hard. 

In the case of iOS, is because we've been using the wrong abstraction level: NSOperationQueues, dispatch_semaphore_create, dispatch_semaphore_wait and other low level GCD functions and structures.

Using the Actor Model, we raise the abstraction level and provide a better platform to build correct concurrent and scalable applications.

Theater is inspired by Akka.
