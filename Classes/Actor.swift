'Actor'

Actors are the central elements of Theater.

## Subclassing notes

You must subclass Actor to implement your own actor classes such as: BankAccount, Device, Person etc.

the single most important to override is
 
```
public func receive(msg : Actor.Message) -> Void
```
 
Which will be called when some other actor tries to ! (tell) you something
